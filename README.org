* just-enough-x11 :: Common Lisp bindings for "just enough" of XCB
  How much is "just enough"? Right now, able to generate wrappers for
  all the X11 requests and events used in [[https://github.com/andrewsoutar/figment][figment]], which is the only
  project using it at the moment. There's a decent chance that it will
  work well with more than that, but no guarantees - it will try to
  bind whatever you want, but you should definitely check the
  parsing/macroexpansion to make sure that it's getting it right. Pull
  requests welcome.
